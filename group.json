They aren't just immigrants struggling to survive in New York City. They aren't just the delivery men and women you don't look at when you open your door. They are the backbone of this city, they are the essential. Most importantly, they are people too and they deserve our respect and recognition now more than ever. Tip generously if you'd like and give them PPE if you can. \n" +

In the past, I've been mistaken as a delivery biker whenever I carry any sort of bag even in my own building, probably because I'm asian. That used to annoy me, but now I realize they're more needed than most of us.\n" +
